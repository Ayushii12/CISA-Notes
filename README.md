# CISA-Notes

## Audit Planning
- A **step-wise approach** to be followed to conduct an audit
- Audit planning is the **initial** stage of the audit process
- Audit planning makes the audit process more **structured**
- Includes both **short-term** and **long-term** planning
- Audit plan should be reviewed and approved by **senior management**
  - Approved audit plan should be **communicated** to the following groups:
    - Senior management
    - Business functions and other stakeholders
    - The internal audit team 
- A well thought out audit plan helps the auditor:
  - Identify required resources
  - Estimate a budget
  - Focus on high-risk areas
- Important terms:
  - **Audit universe**: An inventory of all the **functions/processes/units** under the organization
  - **Qualitative risk assessment**: Risk is assessed using qualitative parameters such as **high, medium, and low**
  - **Quantitative risk assessment**: Risk is assessed using numerical parameters; for example, for a 50% chance of failure, the amount at risk is 1000$
  - **Risk factors**: Factors that have an impact on risk. The presence of such factors increases the risk, whereas their absence decreases the risk
- Steps:
  1. **Understanding the Business**
      - Learn how the company operates
      - Identify important processes
      - Understand how systems and applications are managed and controlled
  2. **Identifying Risks**
      - Determine what could go wrong
      - Spot potential problems in processes, systems, and operations
  3. **Setting Goals and Scope**
      - Define which areas of the business will be audited
      - Establish the timeframe for the audit
  4. **Audit Procedures**
      - Plan specific steps to gather evidence
      - Determine methods to assess systems and processes
  5. **Allocating Resources**
      - Ensure availability of skilled personnel and tools
      - Support efficient and effective audit execution




## Audit Charter
-  A **formal document** defining:
  - Internal audit’s **objective**:
    - Sets the expectations and objectives of the audit function
    - Which processes/departments should be audited?
  - **Authority**:
    - Grants the internal audit function the authority to access:
      - All relevant records, Physical properties and Personnel
    - Empowers auditors to carry out their duties without interference
  - **Responsibility**:
    - Specifies who the audit function reports to (usually the audit committee or senior management)
    - Defines responsibilities such as risk assessments, control evaluations, and compliance reviews
- **Actions** of the **audit department** is primarily influenced by audit charter
- An audit charter must be approved by **senior management**
- Audit charter should not
  - Be changed too often as it defines the objective of the audit function
  - Include things such as planning, resource allocation, and other details such as audit fees and expenses
- An audit charter should be reviewed minimum **annually** to ensure that it is aligned with business objectives




## Business Applications and Controls
- The IS auditor should have sufficient understanding of **overall architecture** and **technical specifications** of the various applications to plan a risk-based audit
- In understanding the **issues** and **current risks** facing the business, the IS auditor should focus on areas that are most **meaningful** to **management**
- The following are some of the widely used applications in business processes. The CISA candidate should be aware of the risks associated with each of them
  - Go over pages 35-42 in the book
 



## Internal control
- An internal control is a **process** used to **safeguard** the **assets** of an **organization**
  - Assets can include systems, data, people, hardware, or the reputation of the organization
- Internal controls help in achieving the objectives of the organization by **mitigating** various risks
- Internal controls are implemented through **policies, procedures, practices, and organizational structures**
- Internal controls provide **assurance** to **management** about the achievement of business objectives
- Through internal controls, risk events are **prevented**, **detected** and **corrected**
- Effective controls in an organization can be categorized into
  - **Preventive**: Prevent occurance of threat and **avoids** the impact of the threat
    - Examples of preventive controls include the following:
      - The use of qualified personnel
      - The segregation of duties
      - The use of SOPs to prevent errors
      - Transaction authorization procedures
      - Edit checks
      - Access control procedures
      - Firewalls
      - Physical barriers 
  - **Detective**: Detect the threat and reduces the potential impact of the threat
    - Examples of detective controls include the following:
      - Internal audits and other reviews
      - Log monitoring
      - Checkpoints in production jobs
      - Echo controls in telecommunications
      - Error messages over tape labels
      - Variance analysis
      - Quality assurance 
  - **Deterrent**: Issue a **warning** signal to **deter** a threat event
  - **Corrective**: **Minimizes** the impact of a threat event once it has occurred
    - Helps in restoring a business to **normal** operations
      - Examples of corrective controls include the following:
        - Business continuity planning
        - Disaster recovery planning
        - Incident response planning
        - Backup procedures
  - **Compensating**: Alternate measures employed to ensure that **weaknesses** in a system are not **exploited**
    - In many cases, a strong control in one area can compensate for a weakness in another area
- **Preventive Vs Deterrent Controls**:
  - When a preventive control is implemented, an intruder is **prevented** from performing an act
    - They **do not have a choice** in whether or not to perform the act
  - When a deterrent control is implemented, the intruder is given a **warning**
    - The intruder **has a choice**: either to act as per the warning or ignore the warning
  - Example: A locked door to a room is a preventive control. Intruders cannot go through the door. On the other hand, just a warning sign that says “No Entry” is a deterrent control. Intruders can ignore the warning and enter the room
- **Control Objective**:
  - The **reason** why a control is implemented
  - Control objectives are linked to **business** objectives
  - Focus on:
    - The **effectiveness** and **efficiency** of operational processes
    - Adherence to **regulatory requirements**
    - The **protection** of **assets**
